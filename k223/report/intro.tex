\section{Introduction}
In a cascade gamma decay of nuclei a non-isotropic angular distribution can be measured due to non-equilibrium spin state; however, in thermal equilibrium net orientation of all spin states is zero due to gamma ray distribution of nuclei is isotropic. Thus, the angular correlation between two gamma rays emitted during the cascaded gamma decay of
the nucleus is due to the unequal spin states distribution in the intermediate states \cite{descr}.
The main motive of the experiment is set up the experiment and investigate nuclear properties of $ ^60Co $ via angular correlation of $ \gamma-\gamma $ cascades\cite{descr}.
