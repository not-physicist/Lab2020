The experiment S261 is designed to motivate with modern astronomical observation and techniques of data analysis. It consists mainly two tasks: data reduction and analysis and CCD properties and observations. 

In this part of the experiment, our main objective is to determine the Hubble constant value. For that, we have calibrated and analyzed an existing set of different quasar images in gravitational lensing system by using the THELI software package. We have obtained data for these images from the 1m telescope at Hoher List Observatory. To full-filled our objective, we have measured the brightness of different quasar images in our calibrated data. And, finally, the Hubble constant has to be determined by the relation with time-delay between the different light paths, which can be measure by minimum dispersion method.
