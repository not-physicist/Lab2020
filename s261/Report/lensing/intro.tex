\section{Introduction}
The Universe expands and the distance between objects increases. This is the Hubble's law~\cite{Rubakov}. A useful parameter is the Hubble parameter $H(t)$. As an important cosmological parameter, current value of Hubble parameter, or Hubble constant in short, $H_0$ plays an essential role in astronomy and cosmology.

Gravitational lensing is a product of general relativity. Lensing could produce multiple images of background objects. By investigating the lens images and time delay, one can determine the Hubble constant, independent of cosmological model. This is a power tool to test current model of the cosmos.

In this chapter, we try to determine the Hubble constant with this method. First off, some key theoretical backgrounds are introduced. Then the whole procedure of observations and analysis will be presented.
