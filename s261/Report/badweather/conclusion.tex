\section{Conclusion}
We have successfully determined several properties of the CCD chip. Dark current and its dependence on temperature. With the obtained information, we can extrapolate to compute dark current at \SI{-25}{\degreeCelsius} and find it will not affect HOLIGRAIL observations. Detector gain is calculated by two different methods and they deliver consistent results. Full-well capacity (saturation level) is determined to relatively high precision.

One can try to compare data from analysis and their reference values. The model name of the CCD chip can be found in the header file: \verb|SBIG STL-6303 3 CCD Camera|. It seems to be commercially available and its specifications are listed for example~\cite{SBIG}
\begin{itemize}
	\item gain: $1.4$ unbinned
	\item full-well capacity: $\num{100 000} e^-$
\end{itemize}
Images we have should all be unbinned, since the header shows the binning is $1\times 1$. Full-well capacity lies roughly $1\sigma$ away from the literature value.
