\section{Introduction}
In this part of this experiment, we determine the properties of CCD mounted at the telescope. Some parts are of great importance for the lensing part, since it directly tells us the quality of images we take.

These measurements have already carried out prior to the actual lab session. In this lab, we can measure the dark current and its dependence on temperature, the detector gain, read-out noise, linearity, and full well capacity.
