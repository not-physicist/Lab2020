\section{Introduction}
In this part of this experiment, we determine the properties of CCD mounted at the telescope. These measurements have already carried out prior to the actual lab session. In this lab, we can measure the dark current and its dependence on temperature, the detector gain, read-out noise, linearity, and full well capacity.
