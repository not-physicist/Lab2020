\section{Introduction}
In this part of this experiment, we can determine the properties of CCD mounted at the telescope. These measurements are carried out at the \SI{50}{\cm} telescope during day-time. But, here, we have just carried out it with already taken data which are provided us by AIFA, Bonn. In this lab, we can measure the dark current and its dependence on temperature, the detector gain and read-out noise, linearity, and full well capacity.
