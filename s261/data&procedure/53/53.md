# Component fitting

## 5.22

- mean of modes: 513.178, exptime = 300
- we used 1.71 as sky value

## 5.26

- residual: looks ok, there is slight bright part, maybe influence of other sources
- magnitude diff = 1.70, coordinates: (29.69, 24.71), (31.11, 31.16)
- chi^2/nu = 44.542

## 5.27

- Cannot be explained by one source
- chi^2/nu = 101.615
