## Reduction of data

## 5.9

- header changed. Not sure how to describe

## 5.10

- a)
- b): bias: free from white dots, flat: brighter
- c): x: 400-700, y: 950-1100; used BIAS_1.fits and image007944_1.fits; sigma: 0.72, 2.27
_ d): min = 0; dithering: get rid of stars?

## 5.11

- structure in superflat: fringes
- fringe.fits: only fringes, in other regions values around 0;  illum.fits: smooth gradient
- a): quite large, around 500
- b): fringes removed, before.jpeg and after.jpeg

## 5.12

## 5.13

- 421 refecreces retrieved

## 5.14

- a): coadd.weight.fits: several white boxes overlapping, some black dots. Has same shape as coadd.weight.fits. coadd.jpeg and coadd.weight.jpeg

- b): x: 650-850, y: 800-1000; sigma=0.02, much lower than previous results. Measured "noise level". expect it to be close to zero, since we coadded all the science frames.
