\section{Voltage determination}\label{sec:vol}

\begin{itemize}
	\item  checked gas system is working

	\item PMT voltage diagram. Don't forget to compare the plot to the one in the setup.

	\item Include overlay and rate plots. In rate plots, it should go down. In overlay, with the right voltage, all pulses should has similar height. Just need to argue somehow why 2.0 is the right voltage.
	\item plots with name ok and bad are the plots in the root files. They should belong to the last bullet point. I beliebe the tutor mentioned that we don't necessarily need these plots in the report.
\end{itemize}
