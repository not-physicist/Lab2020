\paragraph{Shaper}
A shaper is a modoule which turns inputs pulse into logic signals of standard levels and fixed width~\cite{leo}.

\paragraph{TDC}
stands for Time-to-Digital Converter measures the time between two signals and gives the time difference of these two~\cite{leo}.

\paragraph{Coincidence unit}
determines if two or more logic signals overlap with each other within a preset time intervals and output signal if true and no signal if false. The present time is called resolving time. It can be implemented with a transmission gate or simply summing and passing through a discriminator~\cite{leo}.
