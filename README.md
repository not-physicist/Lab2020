## Fold structure

I believe that we would both benefit from a well-structured project. Now I am planning to have separate fold for each experiment, under which there are three parts: Literature, report (LaTex files and graphies), code (python scripts), and possibly more. The figures used in report should be in the report/figs, and generally it would be the best, if the figures generated by scripts get automatically put in here.

## LaTex

There is a main tex file (main.tex) containing all except the actually "text", i.e.~configs, packages, newcommands (really useful). Then the report will be split into several parts according to sections. This would enable us to work in paralell more easily. Bibliography is contained in refs.bib using biblatex with biber.

I use terminal command (under Linux) to compile LaTex files with latexmk, but simple pdflatex with biber commands work just fine (most of time). If you are using some IDE, e.g.~TexStudio, then don't forget to check the backend for the bibliography.

## Python script

Since we might need to reach each other's code, here are just some general good ideas when coding: reasonable variable/function name, modular programming if possible, i.e.~define a function for a specific task, if this task can be summarized in a few words, comments if necessary. 

## Literature

I will put some useful materials found online in this fold.
