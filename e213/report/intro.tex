\section{Introduction}
The Standard Model is essentially a gauge theory with $\mathbf{SU}(3)_C \times \mathbf{SU}(2) \times \mathbf{U}(1)_Y$. The $\mathbf{SU}(2) \times \mathbf{U}(1)$ contains four gauge fields and after symmetry breaking, because of vacuum expectation value of Higgs field, they into $W^{\pm}$, $Z^0$ and $\gamma$ fields. Unlike $\gamma$ which is massless and described by QED, $Z^0$ is massless and couple differently to different chiralities~\cite{Tapei}.

In this experiment we want to determine several properties of $Z^0$ boson, its mass, decay width and couplings. As a byproduct the analysis, we are also able to verify lepton universality and find out number of neutrino generations.

Here we briefly discuss theory and pre-lab problems in first two chapters. Then procedures and analysis of data by events display and statistical analysis in next two chapters will be illustrated.
