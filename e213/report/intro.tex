\section{Introduction}
The standard model of elementary particles classified the $ \text{Z}^0 $-boson as gauge bosons, since spin =1. It acts as a mediator of the fundamental interactions: Electromagnetic, Weak, and Strong \cite{manual}. 

In this experiment we determine the mass of the $ \text{Z}^0 $ and compare with the literature value (91.182 Gev). Also, we want to find width, cross-sections for different decay channels, number of light neutrinos, and weinberg angle. Furthermore, we can check the lepton universality.

Here we briefly discuss theory and pre-lab problems in first two chapters. Then procedures and analysis of data by events display and statistical analysis in next two chapters will be illustrated.
