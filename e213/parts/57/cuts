General cuts:
Pcharged < 200 (energy of LEP cannot be that high)

ee:
cos_thet <= 1 (950 in the beginning)
Ncharged < 4 (get rid of qq)
E_ecal > 60
E_hcal < 2

mm:
cos_thet <= 1 (950 in the beginning)
Ncharged < 4 (get rid of qq)
E_ecal < 60 (get rid of ee)
Pcharged > 70

tt:
Ncharged < 5 (get rid of qq)
Pcharged < 60
Pcharged > 1
E_ecal < 70

qq:
Ncharged > 10

## in the beginning use 950 for the cos_thet. Some pdfs are generated with this cut. After we realized that cos_theta should alwyas be less or equal to 1. Thus we changed the cuts in the end of 5.7. This will not change the plots a lot though.
